Created from an old Minecraft server he had laying around, the server now hosts a wide assortment of music from the Brony fandom.  The station's mascot is Silver Leaf, a Pegasus that enjoys being outdoors surrounded by the elements when she's not plugged into the Mane Frame.  More than a year after its creation, MFR is still committed to providing listeners with a variety of music and being involved in the community, working hard to constantly improve and better provide for our fans.</p>
